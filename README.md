# Gambling-program-prototype
The goal of this program is to get a user to gamble. 
to do this, the user will enter either 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x.
The chances of them making the money back will decrease the higher it gets.
For example 2x should be a 50% chance of winning the money
3x should be a 33.33% chance of winnning
4x should be a 25% chance of winnning
5x should be a 20% chance. (dividing by 100)
The user should enter how much money they have in their wallet, and then how much money they would like to gamble.
if they win, the gambling money should be added back into their wallet, if they lose, then the money should be subtracted from their wallet.
The user should be able to exit after gambling. 




This is kind of a joke I did to get back into programming, it doesn't work but you can see the vision.
